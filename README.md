## Using GitHub Codespaces

A GitHub Codespace is a development environment that is hosted in the cloud that you access via a browser. All of the pre-requisite developer tools for each hack are pre-installed and available in the codespace.

You can use [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) where we have a pre-configured developer environment set up and ready to go for you for some of our hacks.

### GitHub Account

You must have a GitHub account to use GitHub Codespaces. If you do not have a GitHub account, you can [Sign Up Here](https://github.com/signup).

GitHub Codespaces is available for developers in every organization. All personal GitHub.com accounts include a monthly quota of free usage each month. GitHub will provide users in the Free plan 120 core hours, or 60 hours of run time on a 2 core codespace, plus 15 GB of storage each month.

You can see your balance of available codespace hours on the [GitHub billing page](https://github.com/settings/billing/summary).

**NOTE:** Make sure you do not sign in with your enterprise managed Github account.

### Launch Codespace For Selected Hack

The GitHub Codespace for each hack will host student resources, developer CLI tools, and other data files needed for each hack. Here are the steps you will need to follow:

- Sign in to your personal GitHub account
- Click on the green **`Code`** button
- Click on the **`Codespaces`** tab
- Click the ellipsis (...) and select **`New with options...`** from the drop down menu that appears
- From the **`Dev container configuration`** drop down list, select the hackathon you want to launch
- Click the green **`Create codespace`** button

Your Codespace environment should load in a new browser tab. It will take approximately 3-5 minutes the first time you create the codespace for it to load.

- When the codespace completes loading, you should find an instance of Visual Studio Code running in your browser with the files needed for your selected hackathon.

- Follow the instructions in the student guide for your hackathon on the [What The Hack website](https://aka.ms/wth).
